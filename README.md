Record Player Simulation

This project was for IAT 265 for Fall 2021.

The purpose of this project was to design an interactive, media-rich program.



References for Images, Sounds:
All citations/references are in the references folder.

All sounds used in this project are referenced in the "references" folder.
The folder contains multiple .txt files that have the sources.

All graphics are of my own creation, except for the vinyl sleeves.
Vinyl Sleeves have the same reference as the Songs reference as they were taken from the songs.

Any mixing or editing done to the sounds/songs were done using Adobe Audition.



IMPORTANT NOTE:
Console will print
"==== JavaSound Minim Error ====
==== Don't know the ID3 code <tag name>" error
due to reading the songs .mp3 files.

Please ignore this error as the program will run, Minim just
doesn't recognize some custom tags from Adobe Audition.
