## Project Description and Summary

This project is the final assignment for IAT 265 \(Eric Yang\) at SFU.

### Project Takeaways

## Installation Guide
***This project was created through Eclipse but has been tested to run on both IntelliJ and Eclipse.***

### Software Requirements
- **Windows OS** 
  - *This project has not been tested on MacOS!*  
    It may run into errors due to backslash and indexing differences between Windows and MacOS.
  - Windows 7 and up is recommended
- **Latest version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)**
  - IntelliJ is preferred.
    - Either Ultimate or Community version works.
  - Eclipse can be tricky to navigate if the user is not familiar with it.

### Processing and Minim Libraries
Make sure to add the libraries to file path.

## Important Note
Console will print the following warning message:

> ==== JavaSound Minim Error ====  
> ==== Don't know the ID3 code \<tag name\> ====

Please ignore these messages, they are only printed because Minim  
does not recognize certain custom tags from Adobe Audition.
