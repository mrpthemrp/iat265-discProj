## Project Description 

## Libraries and Forking Rules
:warning:***Please DO NOT FORK this project!***:warning:

## Installation Guide
***This project was created through Eclipse but has been tested to run on both IntelliJ and Eclipse.***

### Software Requirements
- **Windows OS** 
  - *This project has not been tested on MacOS!*  
    It may run into errors due to backslash and indexing differences between Windows and MacOS.
  - Windows 7 and up is recommended
- **Latest version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)**
  - IntelliJ is preferred.
    - Either Ultimate or Community version works.
  - Eclipse can be tricky to navigate if the user is not familiar with it.

### Processing and Minim Libraries
Make sure to add the libraries to file path.

## Important Note
Console will print the following warning message:

> ==== JavaSound Minim Error ====  
> ==== Don't know the ID3 code \<tag name\> ====

Please ignore these messages, they are only printed because Minim  
does not recognize certain custom tags from Adobe Audition.

## References
All references to work that is not my own are in the **[references folder](/references)**.

### Images
- Images are in the **[assets folder](/assets)**.
  - Images in the **[sleeves folder](/assets/sleeves)** have the same reference as the songs associated with them.

All graphics are of my own creation using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, except for the vinyl sleeves (see note above).  


### Audio
- Sound effects are in the **[sounds folder](/assets/sounds)**.
  - **[Sounds Citations](/references/SoundsReferencesDoc.txt)**
- Music files are in the **[songs folder](/assets/songs)**.
  - **[Music Citations](/references/SongsReferencesDoc.txt)**

Adobe Audition was used to mix and edit sounds/songs.
