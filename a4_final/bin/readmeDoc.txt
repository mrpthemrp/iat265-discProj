Hello!

All sounds used in this project are referenced in the "references" folder.
The folder contains multiple .txt files that have the sources. 

All graphics were drawn by me, except for the vinyl sleeves. 
Vinyl Sleeves have the same reference as the Songs reference as they were taken from the songs.

Any mixing or editing done to the sounds/songs were done by me
(Deborah Wang) using Adobe Audition.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Console will print 
"==== JavaSound Minim Error ====
==== Don't know the ID3 code <tag name>" error
due to reading the songs .mp3 files.
Please ignore this error as the program works fine, Minim just
doesn't recognize some custom tags from Adobe Audition.
